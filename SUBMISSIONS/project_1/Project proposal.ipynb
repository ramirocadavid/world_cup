    "# Penalty shootout game - Project proposal\n",
    "\n",
    "This document describes the user experience of a soccer penalty kicks game and its code internal structure, i.e. each class functionalities, attributes and interactions with other classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Game description\n",
    "\n",
    "\"A penalty shoot-out (officially kicks from the penalty mark) is a method of determining which team advances or is awarded the championship of an association football match that cannot end in a draw but where the score is tied after the regulation playing time as well as extra time (if used) have expired. In a penalty shoot-out, each team takes turns attempting a specified number of shots on the goal from the penalty mark (5 in FIFA-governed football) that are defended only by the opposing team's goalkeeper, with the team that makes more successful kicks being declared the winner of the match.\" Source: [Wikipedia][1]\n",
    "\n",
    "[1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_(association_football)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Justification\n",
    "This game is composed of several classes and subclasses that have different types of relationships with each other, either by using other objects attributes as inputs or by having methods that update other classes attributes. I think that the user interface may also be challenging with respect to defining how the inputs will be entered, what the right sound and images will be and the right predictability and complexity levels. All this needs to be considered in order to make the game realistic and fun. For these reasons, I expect the development of this game to be complex enough to meet these project's goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## User experience\n",
    "\n",
    "The game will ideally be played by two players, but it can be played by up to 12, grouped in two teams. The user experience of the players involved will follow the process described below.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Configuration**\n",
    "1. Create at least two teams\n",
    "1. Create at least 6 players per team (one goalkeeper and five shooters)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Game setup**\n",
    "1. Select the two teams that will play the game\n",
    "1. Select at least 5 players per team\n",
    "\n",
    "**Game**:\n",
    "1. There will be initially 5 pairs of penalty kicks, where the teams will take turns to kick the penalty or catch it.\n",
    "1. In each kick, if the ball ends up inside the goal, one point will be scored to the kicker's team.\n",
    "1. If after 5 pairs of kicks the teams end up with the same amount of points, they will move to play one pair of kicks. They will keep playing one pair of kicks until one of the teams misses and the other scores in one of these pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Code structure\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "The classes that will compose the game are described below. Details about contents of attributes and inner workings of methods are included when their names are not self-explanatory. The classes are classified into those used to setup the game (Configuration classes), to setup the match (Game setup classes) and to play the game (Game classes).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Configuration classes\n",
    "\n",

    "    - Score\n",
    "    - Kicks: list of kicks associated with this game\n",
    "    - Number of kicks: tuple that indicates the kick number and the last team that shoot\n",

    "    - Score: Keeps score up to last kick\n",
    "    - Winner: winner of the match, once it's finished, otherwise is None\n",

    "    - Update winner: the winner will only be updated at the end of the game, but this method will also be in charge of deciding when a team has won.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Game Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Kick**: setup each kick, with information on each participating player's strategy and the result of the combination of both strategies.\n",

    "    - Strategies: tuple containing the strategy of the shooter and the goalkeeper.\n",
    "    - Result: stores result generated in the result method   \n",

    "**Strategy**\n",

    "    - Player: player object that decides on the strategy\n",
    "    - Potency: numeric level of potency with which the ball is shoot\n",

    "    - Margin of error: randomly selected error value within a default range\n",
    "- Methods\n",
    "    - Kick destination: calculates the final destination that the ball will have when it reaches the goal\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Other features\n",
    "- The program might have sound effects and images that represent the result of each kick and game. However, this may require the use of libraries outside of the Anaconda distribution.\n",
    "- Each player's input should be blurred to avoid the other player(s) seeing the user input.\n",
    "- A random error will be added to each strategy to reduce the predictability of the players's and the adversarie's strategy (e.g. a player can choose a kick in a direction far from the center, which is harder for the goalkeeper to cathcc, but this will imply a higher probability that the ball misses the soccer goal)."
