    "\n",
    "The following figure depicts Galton's box, a game in which marbles are dropped through N rows of pins.  In row 0, there is one position a marble can be in (labeled 0), in row 1, there are two positions (labeled 0 and 1), and so forth.  Each time the marble bounces from one row to the next, there is a 50% probability it bounces left and a 50% probability it bounces right.\n",

    "<img src=\"Galton2.jpg\">\n",

    "\n",
    "Create a class, **Marble**, to represent a single Marble that will drop through Galton's Box.  You should include attributes to represent the position of the marble.  Additionally, your \\_\\_init\\_\\_ method should accept a one-character label for use when printing the Marble.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, create a class, **GaltonBox**, to represent the overall setup.  You should include the following methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "- \\_\\_init\\_\\_ - Your initializer should accept the size of the box, N.\n",
    "- insert\\_marble - This method should accept a Marble instance and sets its position to position 0, row 0.\n",
    "- time\\_step - This method should cause all Marbles in Galton's box to bounce to the next row, dropping left or right with equal probability.  When a marble reaches row N-1 at the bottom of the box, it should not move any more.  Note that you should simply allow marbles to occupy the same position (instead of working out a system to prevent a Marble from entering a position if another Marble is already there).\n",
    "- \\_\\_str\\_\\_ and \\_\\_repr\\_\\_ - Include methods to display the Marbles currently in the box.  To keep things simple, if there are multiple Marbles in a given position, you only have to display one of the labels.\n",
